https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

###Installation and Run

* Please clone this repository to your prefered directory in your machine
* Open RStudio, set working directory to the directory from the above step (in RStudio, go to Session -> Set Working Directory )
* Now you should see the file run_analysis.R. Run all the codes
* If you have not installed package "data.table", please uncomment the code at line number 8
* It will around 2-3 minutes to download the dataset and run the codes. It is not required, but recommended that you have a cup of coffee while waiting
* Run the code
* If succesfully completed, you should see a new file named tidy_data.txt
